- Batted Ball Event (BBE)
    - A Batted Ball Event represents any batted ball that produces a result.
- Pitch Velocity
    - How hard, in miles per hour, a pitch is thrown.
- Pitch Movement
    - The movement of a pitch is defined in inches, both in raw numbers and as a measurement against average.
- Active Spin
    - Statcast refers to the spin that contributes to movement as Active Spin.
- Spin Rate
    - How much spin, in revolutions per minute, a pitch was thrown with.
- Extension
    - How far off the mound, in feet, a pitcher releases the pitch.
- Pop Time
    - How quickly, in seconds, a catcher can get the ball out of his glove and to the base on a stolen base or pickoff attempt.

    - How far, in feet, a fielder or runner has traveled on a play.
- Lead Distance
    - How far, in feet, a runner is ranging off the bag at the time of a pitcher's first movement or pitch release.
- Jump
    - Jump is a Statcast metric that shows which players have the fastest reactions and most direct routes in the outfield.
- Outs Above Average (OAA)
    - A range-based metric of skill that shows how many outs a player has saved over his peers.
- Catch Probability
    - The likelihood, in percent, that an outfielder will be able to make a catch on an individual batted ball.
- Expected Batting Average (xBA)
    - xBA measures the likelihood that a batted ball will become a hit.
- Expected Weighted On-base Average (xwOBA)
    - xwOBA is formulated using exit velocity, launch angle and, on certain types of batted balls, Sprint Speed.

    - xERA is a simple 1:1 translation of xwOBA, converted to the ERA scale
- Sprint Speed
