<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are so many ways to become a better programmer. I decided to take the route that would allow me to become a better programer while also building a tool that could possibly make me more passive income, if done well.

Why?
* Everyone loves a little extra money
* Sports Betting is extremely complex, therefore, it becomes a good candidate to be able to grab bite size pieces of information amongst a sea of data
* The opportunity for me to teach people about Data + Sports, some of my favorite topics

This will not be able to cover everything, but it's an attempt to get a funcioning model. Let's do that first. Build the model, build the backtesting features, and then we will add in complexities. Gather the data, format it, store it, statistical inference, model building, and then do it all again.

This is a complex project, and the end goal is one that we all love to think about, but we won't forget about the steps needed to get there.

## Contributing

I am currently working on a YouTube channel where I stream my work on this project for people to follow along. I am interested and passionate about the democratization of Education, as some of my most valuable learning has come from free sources like Coursera Audits and YouTube University.
